1. This example is a hybrid: TeX source was puth through a converter, then
adjusted manually with regular expressions from Vim. 
Therefore all those &nbsp; lines, which otherwise would not be present in
literate source, only automatically inserted by Molly in the "folding html'
output of its weaver.

2. I did not even download references; Molly does not have functionality to
automatically number equations and definitions, or deal with foonotes or
references.  It might be the TeX to HTML converted could deal with refs if I
included them

3. \dots in the original had to be changed to \ldots to display correctly

4. TeX escapes $....$ for math were changed to ``...`` not to conflict with
other parts of the document

5. Display of some elements with the math font included with Firefox and
Opera looks ugly (and is almost unreadable for some "h"-like  and "h*"
characters).

It is possible to avoid using ASCIIMathML.js and use mimeTeX directly; it
will produce images (supposedly better rendered). 

Multiple gif images for math formulas could be saved exactly like
ASCIIMathML.js copy is saved inside the output.mht file.
