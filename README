WHAT IS MOLLY?

Files in this repository relate to "MOLLY", a MO-dule for LI-terate programming.
Technically, it is a "weaver" which can create "folding html" documents on the fly,
working either from command line or as CGI under a developer's personal web server.

The module is a simple script written in core perl, no extra modules are needed.

Full use for Literate Programming will require installing "noweb" tools by Norman
Ramsey (see documentation). But it has a simple built-in tangler which can
tangle itself out.

MOLLY also allows for the use of MathML (via a great third-party javascript library),
i.e.  mathematical expressions typed in a simple ASCII notation will be turned
into fully-formatted MathML output to get displayed by Firefox, Opera (or other
MathML-aware browsers) on the fly.

THE FILES IN THE PROJECT:

"MOLLY.html" is the extracted folding html documentation for the project.
Get and read it first. Make user JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
"eeerotate.jpg" is an illustration for the file.

"MOLLY.weave" is a literate source file for the project, one main project file
which includes all documentation and code, tests, todo and bugs subsections etc.

"MOLLY.pl" is the pre-extracted perl module.

"ASCIIMathML.js" is a slightly modified JavaScript library that enables
MathML inside your weaved HTML file. If you wish to use MathML in the project, 
get it as well AND enable the switches in the header of your template file.

"new_project_template.weave" is a skeleton file to copy and use when you
start a new project. Rename it preserving the file extension (or set a new
file extension in config at the top of it -- see MOLLY documentation)
It can be solf-linked to another name, "new_project_template.tangle" if
you also wish to tangle through MOLLY for speed during development

Please, get MOLLY.html first and read it. Again, make sure JavaScript is
enabled in your  browser.
