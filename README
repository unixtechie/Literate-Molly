WHAT IS MOLLY?

Files in this repository relate to "MOLLY", a MO-dule for LI-terate programming.
Technically, it is a standalone tool for literate programming with a new
kind of "weaver" which can create "folding html" documents on the fly,
working either from command line or as CGI under a developer's personal
web server.

Molly is a simple script written in core perl, no extra modules are needed.

Molly shares literate markup with "noweb" tools by Norman Ramsey, so for
flexible tangling you might wish also to instal them. Molly however can
tangle from a project split into many Literate Source files, what "noweb"
cannot do.
 
MOLLY also can directly use MathML (a great LGPLed third-party javascript
library), i.e.  mathematical expressions typed in a simple ASCII notation
with LaTeX constants will be turned into MathML output to get displayed by
Firefox, Opera (or other MathML-aware browsers) on the fly.


CURRENT VERSION FEATURES:

    * creates folding documents on the fly from Literate Source files..
    * ..based on rawHTML or dotHTML markup in document sections
    /i.e. either creates new docs or displays some existing HTML in folding fmt/
    * and generates dynamically TOC and code chunks index;
    * ties collapsing/expandind of sections with TOC highlighting.
    * Provides pass-through tangling with "noweb" and
    * provides built-in fully-fledged tangler
    * provides a (trivial) tie to ASCIIMathML.js library for inclusion of 
	mathematical expressions in your documents.
    * can tangle and weave from command line like traditiona lit prog tools
    * allows for the project to be split into several files or reassembled
	at will: the tangler can process many LitSrc files on command line.
    * has options to print all roots in your progect, autodetects cycles 
	(unchecked fully)
    * can print comments with line numbers referring to the Lit Source in
	the tangled output


This script is a test of the concept (LitProg+folding+dynamic web formatting)


FILES IN THE PROJECT:

"MOLLY.html" is the extracted folding html documentation for the project.
Get and read it first. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
"eeerotate.jpg" is an illustration for the file.

"MOLLY.weave" is a literate source file for the project, one main project file
which includes all documentation and code, tests, todo and bugs subsections etc.

"MOLLY.pl" is the pre-extracted perl module (i.e. weaver and tangler)

"ASCIIMathML.js" is an excellent LGPLed  JavaScript library that enables
MathML inside a weaved HTML file. If you wish to use MathML in the project, 
get it as well AND enable the switches in the header of your template file.

"new_project_template.weave" is a skeleton file to copy and use when you
start a new project. Rename it preserving the file extension (or set a new
file extension in config at the top of it -- see MOLLY documentation)
It can be solf-linked to another name, "new_project_template.tangle" if
you also wish to tangle through MOLLY for speed during development

Please, get MOLLY.html first and read it. Again, make sure JavaScript is
enabled in your  browser.
