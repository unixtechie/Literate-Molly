WHAT IS MOLLY?

Files in this repository relate to "MOLLY", a MO-dule for LI-terate programming.
Technically, it is a standalone tool for literate programming with a new
kind of "weaver" which can create "folding html" documents on the fly,
working either from command line or as CGI under a developer's personal
web server.

Molly is a simple script written in core perl, no extra modules are needed.

Molly shares literate marku with "noweb" tools by Norman Ramsey, so for
more flexible tangling you might wish also to instal them as well.
 
MOLLY also can directly use MathML (a great LGPLed third-party javascript
library), i.e.  mathematical expressions typed in a simple ASCII notation
with LaTeX constants will be turned into MathML output to get displayed by
Firefox, Opera (or other MathML-aware browsers) on the fly.


FILES IN THE PROJECT:

"MOLLY.html" is the extracted folding html documentation for the project.
Get and read it first. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
"eeerotate.jpg" is an illustration for the file.

"MOLLY.weave" is a literate source file for the project, one main project file
which includes all documentation and code, tests, todo and bugs subsections etc.

"MOLLY.pl" is the pre-extracted perl module (i.e. weaver and tangler)

"ASCIIMathML.js" is an excellent LGPLed  JavaScript library that enables
MathML inside a weaved HTML file. If you wish to use MathML in the project, 
get it as well AND enable the switches in the header of your template file.

"new_project_template.weave" is a skeleton file to copy and use when you
start a new project. Rename it preserving the file extension (or set a new
file extension in config at the top of it -- see MOLLY documentation)
It can be solf-linked to another name, "new_project_template.tangle" if
you also wish to tangle through MOLLY for speed during development

Please, get MOLLY.html first and read it. Again, make sure JavaScript is
enabled in your  browser.
