Files in this repository relate to "MOLLY", a MO-dule for LI-terate programming.
Technically, it is a "weaver" which can create "folding html" documents on the fly,
working either from command line or as CGI under a developer's personal web server.

The module is written in basic perl; full use for Literate Programming will require
installing "noweb" tools by Norman Ramsey (see documentation). At least for now ;))

"MOLLY.weave" is a literate source file for the project, one main project file
which includes all documentation and code, tests, todo and bugs subsections etc.

"MOLLY.pl" is the extracted perl module.
"MOLLY.html" is the extracted folding html documentation for the project.

Please, get MOLLY.html first and read it. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your
